  # method_missing in Service. Instances of this class are created
  # internally by the Service in it's handling of a method call and you
  # should not have to create instances of this class directly.
  #
  # Instead, to use an API filter, you add a filter method to the call
  # chain when you call a method through a SoftLayer::Service
  #
  # For example, given a SoftLayer::Service instance called "account_service"
  # you could take advantage of the API filter that identifies a particular
  # object known to that service using the 'object_with_id" method :
  #
  #     account_service.object_with_id(91234).getSomeAttribute
  #
  # The invocation of object_with_id will cause an instance of this
  # class to be instantiated with the service as its target.
